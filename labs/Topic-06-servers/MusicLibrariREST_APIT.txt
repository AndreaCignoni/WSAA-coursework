Title: Design Document for a Music Library REST API

Introduction:
Purpose: This document outlines the design of a RESTful API for a music library system.
Objective: To provide developers with clear guidelines for building and interacting with the music library API.
Scope: The API will allow users to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on music tracks, albums, artists, and playlists.
Data Formats: JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) will be used for data exchange between the client and server.

Endpoints:

/tracks:
GET: Retrieve a list of tracks.
POST: Add a new track.
/tracks/{id}:
GET: Retrieve details of a specific track.
PUT: Update information of a track.
DELETE: Delete a track.


Data Model:
Track:
ID
Title
Artist ID


Testing:

- Develop the "getAll" functionality and conduct testing to ensure its proper implementation.
- Implement the "findById" feature and perform testing to verify its accuracy.
- Create the "create" functionality and subject it to comprehensive testing to validate its correct operation.
- Integrate the "update" capability and conduct thorough testing to confirm its effectiveness.
- Establish the "delete" functionality and undergo testing to ascertain its proper execution.


This document provides a blueprint for designing and implementing a robust RESTful API for a music library system, ensuring scalability, security, 
and ease of use for developers and end-users alike.
