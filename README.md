## WEB SERVICES AND APPLICATIONS

<div align=\"justify\">

This repository contains code related to web services and applications. It is organized into two main directories:

1. **lab**: This directory contains practice code.

2. **assignments**: This directory contains specific assignments and projects.

## Lab

The `lab` directory consists of code snippets and small programs created during the learning process. These codes are associated with various lessons and serve as practice exercises.

## Assignments

### Current Weather Program

Inside the `assignments` directory, you will find the `currentweather.py` Python program. This program is designed to print the current temperature and wind direction on the console.

#### Instructions:

1. **Temperature:**
   - The program will print out the current temperature at a specified location.
   - The default location is set to the latitude and longitude of the owner's location. You can modify these values if you wish to get the temperature for a different location.

2. **Wind Direction (10m):**
   - The program uses an external API to fetch weather data.
   - Refer to the documentation below for details on accessing the wind direction (10m).
   - Implement the necessary code to print out the current wind direction on the console along with the temperature.

#### Usage:

Execute the program using the following command:

```bash
python currentweather.py
```

### External API Documentation:

The program utilizes an external weather API to retrieve weather information. Please refer to the documentation below for details on accessing the wind direction and other parameters:
